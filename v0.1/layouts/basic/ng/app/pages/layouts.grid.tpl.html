  Theming allows changing the color of your Angular Material application. If you need
  more custom styling (such as layout changes including padding, margins, etc) you
  will need to either write CSS rules with custom selectors, or build a custom version
  of the angular-material.css file using SASS and custom variables.</p>
<p>There are some predefined themes in ngLaunchpad. To change your theme, change the
  <code>NGM_THEME</code> in the <code>project_settings.py</code> file.</p>
